# DefaultPrinterSelector

A lightweight utility for easily changing the default printer.  

In Dentrix, all print jobs automatically print to the default printer.  This means users have to switch default printers when they switch from printing Appointment Labels to printing full sheet documents.  
Putting this utility on the taskbar can significantly ease and speed this for general users.
